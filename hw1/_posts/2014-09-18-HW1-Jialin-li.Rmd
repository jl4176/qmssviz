This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/New Porject/qmssviz/Lab1")
dat = read.table('Donation-Disease.csv',sep=',',header=TRUE)
plot(x = dat$MoneyRaised,y=dat$Death,xlab="MoneyRaised",ylab="Death")
barplot(dat$Death,names.arg = dat$Name)
barplot(dat$MoneyRaised,names.arg = dat$Name)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
